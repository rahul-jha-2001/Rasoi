# Restaurant Marketplace

## Overview
The Restaurant Marketplace is a **scalable microservices-based platform** that allows restaurants to manage their menus, take orders, and engage customers with notifications. The system is built using **Django, gRPC, Kafka, and FastAPI**, with an API Gateway handling external interactions.

## Architecture
The platform follows a **microservices architecture**, with the following key components:

### **Core Services**
- **User Service**: Manages authentication and user data.
- **Menu Service**: Handles restaurant menus and item availability.
- **Product Service**: Stores product details and pricing.
- **Cart Service**: Manages users' cart data before checkout.
- **Order Service**: Processes and tracks orders, ensuring proper state management.
- **Notification Service**: Sends OTPs, order updates, and marketing messages via an external API.

### **Communication**
- **gRPC**: Used for internal service-to-service communication.
- **Kafka**: Used for event-driven messaging, such as sending notifications or processing order updates.
- **REST API**: External-facing API, exposed via an API Gateway.

### **Deployment**
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: The entire system is containerized for scalability.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated deployment and testing are integrated.
